# Brainhack School 2020 Project

Team contributors: Stephanie Alley

## Summary

## Project definition

### Background
I am a third year PhD student at Polytechnique with a background in MRI. My primary goal for this project is to become more proficient with tools that promote open, reproducible science, so I am fairly open to a variety of MRI dataset options and analyses. I am considering a project that explores the effect of pre-processing on some type of ML-based analysis, but nothing is definitive at this point.

### Tools
* Python
* Docker
* BIDS
* Visualization (matplotlib, plotly)
* DataLad

### Data
The data should be obtained from an open repository (TBD).
